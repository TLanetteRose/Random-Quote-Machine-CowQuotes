My Random Quote Generator project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Background
The goal of the project was to build an app that would generate random quotes and allow the user to tweet the quotes. 

## Dependencies
In addition to building this app using Create React App, this app uses the following library(s):
* [FortAwesome](https://fortawesome.com/) : used for the Twitter icon
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) : Hepta Slab was used for the body font and Mansalva was used for the titles
* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/): to provide styling and position for the app

## Installations
React Bootstrap and FortAwesome were imported into the QuoteMachine component file. 

## How I Created My App
I referred to the project's User Story guidelines developed by [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) for their Front End Libraries Certificate.
